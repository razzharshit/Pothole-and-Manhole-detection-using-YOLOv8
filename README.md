# Pothole-and-Manhole-detection-using-YOLOv8
Developed a YOLOv8-based deep learning model for real-time detection of road defects including potholes, manholes, and cracks. Collected and annotated dataset, applied image augmentation, and fine-tuned YOLOv8 to achieve high accuracy on images and videos for traffic safety applications.
